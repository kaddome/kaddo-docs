# 04 -  Privacy settings

## Description
As a user I want to edit my privacy settings to be more specific about who can request my delivery details

## Acceptance criteria

### 1 - As an exsiting user I want to receive gifts by any hoozad user  

**Given** I am in the hoozad privacy settings page  
**When** I select the option "Receive from any hoozad user"  
**Then** My delivery details will be shared with any hoozad user  

### 2 - As an exsiting user I want to receive gifts only by facebook connections  

**Given** I am in the hoozad privacy settings page  
**When** I select the option "Receive from facebook connections"  
**Then** My delivery details will be shared with any facebook connection   

### X - As a user I have registered to only receive gifts from Hoozad friends
```
Do we need this? Does make sense?
```
### X - As a user I have registered to not receive gifts but to only send
```
How can we avoid this scenario??
